# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You have been tasked with evaluating the use of Azure Recovery Services for backup and restore of files hosted on Azure virtual machines and on-premises computers.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

+ Task 1: Provision the lab environment
+ Task 2: Create a Recovery Services vault
+ Task 3: Implement Azure virtual machine-level backup
+ Task 4: Implement File and Folder backup

## Estimated timing: 45 minutes

## Instructions

### Exercise 1

#### Task 1: Provision the lab environment

#### Pre-work task

Go to the Templates folder on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/grozdanovd/MicrosoftAzureExpertWorkshop/tree/master/Templates). On each file in the folder, right click on each select **Save link as**, and choose the **Desktop** as location for the two files.

In this task, you will deploy two virtual machines that will be used to test different backup scenarios.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. 

    >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell** and you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and click **Create storage**. 

1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, click the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu, click **Upload** and upload the files **d2.02-vms-template.json** and **d2.02-vms-parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the resource group that will be hosting the virtual machines:

   ```pwsh
   $location = 'westeurope'

   $rgName = 'd2-02-rg0'

   New-AzResourceGroup -Name $rgName -Location $location
   ```
1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the first virtual network and deploy a virtual machine into it by using the template and parameter files you uploaded:

   ```pwsh
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
      -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
      -TemplateFile $HOME/d2.02-vms-template.json `
      -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/d2.02-vms-parameters.json `
      -AsJob
   ```

1. Minimize Cloud Shell (but do not close it).

    >**Note**: Do not wait for the deployment to complete but instead proceed to the next task. The deployment should take about 5 minutes.

#### Task 2: Create a Recovery Services vault

In this task, you will create a recovery services vault.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Recovery Services vaults** and, on the **Recovery Services vaults** blade, click **+ Add**.

#### Clean up resources

   >**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. List all resource groups created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```pwsh
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'd2-02*'
   ```

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```pwsh
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'd2-02*' | Remove-AzResourceGroup -Force -AsJob
   ```

   >**Note**: Optionally, you might consider deleting the auto-generated resource group with the prefix **AzureBackupRG_** (there is no additional charge associated with its existence).

    >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.

#### Review

In this lab, you have:

- Provisioned the lab environment
